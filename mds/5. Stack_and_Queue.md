# Stack and Queue

Stack follows the **LIFO** rule while queue follows the **FIFO**.



## Basic syntax

#### collections.deque

A generalized implementation of stacks and queues, double-ended queue. It costs $O(1)$ to insert and delete element in the head and back of the queue. Do not `slice or access subscript` of the deque, it costs $O(n)$ (but [0] and [-1] is OK). Just use the list when you need to do that. Deque is not continuous in memory.

``` python
d = deque([0,1,2]) # can be list/set/string/tuple/dict(only put keys in the deque)

d.append(3)           # deque([0,1,2,3])
d.appendleft('a')     # deque(['a',0,1,2,3])
d.extend('ll')        # deque(['a',0,1,2,3,'l','l'])
d.extendleft((1,0))   # deque([0,1,'1',0,1,2,3,'l','l'])

element = d.pop()     # deque([0,1,'1',0,1,2,3,'l']), element='l'
deque().pop()       # IndexError: pop from an empty deque
element = d.popleft() # deque([1,'1',0,1,2,3,'l']), element=0

d = deque([1,2,3], maxlen=3)
d.append(4)           # deque([2,3,4])
d.appendleft(5)       # deque([5,2,3])

### list methods
len(d)
d[-1]    # there's no deque.top(), just use this
d[:-1]   # TypeError: sequence index must be integer, not 'slice'
d.count(0)
d.index('l')
d.insert(0,'b')
d.remove('b')
d.clear()

d = deque([1,2,3,4,5])
d.rotate(2)   # rotate in clockwise, deque([4,5,1,2,3])
d.rotate(-3)  # rotate in anticlockwise, deque([2,3,4,5,1])
```

#### heapq(move to the binary tree later)

Using list to implement heap algorithm(min-heap in default): `heap[k] <= heap[2k+1]` and `heap[k] <= heap[2k+2]`, indexed from 0. Insert and delete will maintain the heap, $O(logn)$.

```python
##### create a min-heap
# 1. from empty
a = []
heapq.heappush(a,1)             # [1]
heapq.heappush(a,18)            # [1,18], O(logn)
# 2. from list
a = [18,1]                      # a=[(1,'a'),(2,'b')] is ok, heap will sort by the first element
heapq.heapify(a)                # [1,18], O(n)
##### create a max-heap
a = list(map(lambda x: -x, a))
heap.heapify(a)                 # [-18,-1]
a = list(map(lambda x: -x, a))  # [18,1]

##### get the top
b = heapq.heappop(a)            # O(logn). It will maintain the heap structure.

```

## Problems

> [232. Implement Queue using Stacks](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/description/)

â€‹	(output stack) ][ (input stack)

Just like the above, two stacks can compose a queue, with the left one acting as `output stack` and the right acting as `input stack`. Each time an element is put in the queue, put it into the input stack, and whenever popping out an element, pop it from the output stack. When output stack is empty, pop all elements of input stack to the output stack one by one.

> [225. Implement Stack using Queues](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-stack-using-queues/)

When input 1,2,3 -> stack: 3,2,1] , we should make the queue arrange like: 3,2,1

- input 1 -> `1`
- input 2 -> 1,`2` -> `2`,1
- input 3 -> 2,1,`3` -> 1,`3`,2 -> `3`,2,1

Whenever inputing an element in queue, pop and push the elements before it one by one.

### Monotonic queue/stack

It maintains a stack where the elements are monotonous. Used for problems related to `sliding windows`:

- search for a max/greater in a interval, and the max/greater can be common for many elements.
- keep a descending or ascending sequence of some elements(the stack is what we want).

Tricks: 

- construct example data and simulate by hand.
- all the elements must be pushed in stack at least once.
- remove the elements that are useless in the future, keep the stack sorted in the same time.

> [239. Sliding window maximum](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/description/)

keep a monotonic queue to record the **possible maximum**. eg, $1,3,6,2,5,1,7$; k=4.

- push 1 into queue, q: 1

- push 3 into queue, 1 is no longer max, q: 3

- push 6 into queue, 3 is no longer max, q: 6

- push 2 into queue, 2 is `possible max` when 6 get out, q: 6,2

- slide the window, 6 is still inside. $3,6,2,5$

  push 5 into queue, 2 is no longer max, 5 is possible max, q: 6,5

- slide the window, 6 is still inside. $6,2,5,1$

  push 1 into queue, q: 6,5,1

- slide the window, 6 get out. $2,5,1,7$

  q.popleft(), push 7 into queue, q: 7

**record the index of nums** into q, so you can check out whether q[0] is still in the window.

> [503. Next Greater Element 2](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/description/)

Also a **sliding window problem**: when searching for the greater, the window extends; when the left is updated, the window shrinks.

keep a monotonic queue to record the element that **currently haven't found the corresponding next greater element**. Once a greater is found, update the elements in the queue.

- initiate the ans with -1 -> the maximum of the list won't be updated.

- search the circular list twice: 

  ```python
  for i in range(n * 2 - 1):
  ```

- get the index with % and record the index in the queue.

  ```python
  while stk and nums[stk[-1]] < nums[i % n]:
      ret[stk.pop()] = nums[i % n]
  stk.append(i % n)
  ```

> [316. Remove Duplicate Letters](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicate-letters/)

1. Keep the ascending sequence of the stack.
2. Remove the duplicate elements in the stack.

Use a dict to count the **remaining element c nums** to decide whether to pop the element c in stack. Use a set to record the existing elements in the stack, so **do not push in when c is already in stack**.

> [581. Shortest Unsorted Continuous](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-unsorted-continuous-subarray/)

###### monotonic stack -> $O(2n)$

**Left boundary**: searching from left to right, use an ascending stack to keep the sequence and find the minimum index of the popped elements.

**Right boundary**: searching from right to left, use a descending stack to keep the sequence and find the maximum index of the popped elements.

**Popped elements**: the ones that not in order.

###### Two pointers -> $O(n)$

![](../figures/581.png)

- Keep the **minn** and **maxn** to find the **minimum num** and **maximum num** in the middle unsorted part. 

- Search from left to right to update **maxn**. If sorted, maxn will be updated in every searching step. Once meeting a smaller num, it means the num is not in order, point the **right boundary pointer** to it.

- Likewise, **minn** and **left boundary pointer** can be updated during the right to left searching.

> [84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/description/)

![](../figures/84.png)

**Brute Force:** 

- enumerate weights -> find the maximum area in the given weight

- enumerate heights -> find the left and right bounds that can maintain the given bounds

**Mononic stack:**

enumerate heights -> find the bounds -> `first smaller column`



Considering the left bound, traverse from left to right. The stack keeps **the possible first smaller column**: 2 -> 1 -> 1,5 -> 1,5,6 -> 2 -> 2,3. Updating the left bound of each column when traversing the list.

Time complexity: find left bound -> $O(n)$, find right bound -> $O(n)$, calculate the area -> $O(n)$

Space complexity: left bound records -> $O(n)$, right bound records -> $O(n)$, stack -> $O(n)$



**Optimization**:

- get the left and right bounds at the same time -> when pop(), the right bound of the popped element is the current element.
- set the left sentinel 0 and right sentinel 0 to reduce additional judgement.
