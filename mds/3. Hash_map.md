# Hash_Map

set() or dict() in python, O(1) in query/insert/delete. Used when you need to detect whether an element(and its value) exists in the set. The keys in the dict are hashed, so querying the keys is also O(1)

## Basic syntax

#### create/delete a set/dict

```python
####### set
a = {'a','b',1} # element in set should be hashable(unchangeable), list,dict,set is not allowed.
a = {[1,3]} # not allowed. unhashable.
a = set([1,2])

a = set() # create an empty set
a = {} # create an empty dictionary

del a
a.pop() # remove a ramdom element

####### dict
a = {'a':1, 1:['ab'], (1,2):()} # key in dict should be hashable(unchangeable), list,dict,set is not allowed.
							    # and the key is unique in a dict.
a = dict.fromkeys("abc",0)  # {'a':0, 'b':0, 'c':0}, param1 needs to be iterable.

a = dict()
a = {}
a = collections.defaultdict(int)

del a
del a['a']
a.pop('a')

##### Counter, a subclass of dict
cnt = collections.Counter('aabbbc')  # counter({'b':3, 'a':2, 'c':1}), from large to small
a['d']                 # 0, not KeyError
cnt['c'] -= 1        # counter({'b':3, 'a':2, 'c':1}) can be printed
list(cnt.elements()) # ['b','c']
```

#### operations

```python
####### set
a.add('z') # {'a','b','z'}

b = {'a','b','m'} 
a.update(b) # {'a','b','z','m'}
len(a)

a.remove('q') # error
a.discard('q') # {'a','b','z','m'}
a.clear()  # set()

'a' in a # False

###### dict
a['b']=2
a.get('a', default=None)

'a' in a # True, 'in' can search the keys in dict, O(1)
len(a)
dict1 == dict2

# returns a view object, which is read-only, and change dynamically according to the dict.
a.keys()
a.items()
a.values()
```

#### calculation

```python
a = set('abcdefg')
b = set('abz')

diff = a - b # {'d', 'c', 'g', 'f', 'e'}
union = a | b # {'z', 'b', 'd', 'c', 'g', 'a', 'f', 'e'}
intersection = a & b # {'b', 'a'}
inverse_intersection = a ^ b # {'z', 'e', 'd', 'g', 'f', 'c'}
```

## In total

For hashmap, there are different implementations: Array, set, dictionary.

- **Array**: used for the elements are limited, like alphabet. This can save the space (in contrast to Red-black tree) and save the hash operation.
- **Set**: used for vast elements or sparse keys. Array will waste a lot of space in these case.
- **Dictionary**: used for elements contain more than one value. Like index and value are both needed to be recorded.

## Problems

> [12. Integer to Roman](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-roman/)

Simulation problems should abandon unnecessary if...else.

> [438. Find All Anagrams in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/)

For changeable but in a fixed range keys, it would be better to use handcraft hashmap like `[0]*26`. It is easy to edit keys that firstly not in the hashmap. And also easy to compare different hashmaps.

### two sum

> [1. two sum](https://leetcode.cn/problems/two-sum/) *

**Target**: search the index of the complement(target-x) efficiently for each x.

- binary search
- convert list into a dict with values: index, thus each search is O(1) // two-pass (need the )
- for each x, search the element before it, then add current {x:i} into dict. // one-pass

> [128. Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)

Variation of two sum. First consider brute force: fix one possible minimum x of the sequence, find x+1, x+2, ... in the remaining nums.

Optimization: create a hashmap of the nums first. Then the find operation can be finished in O(1)

> [15. 3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/) *

==All the number sum problem can convert to 2Sum==: traverse the first number x, and find the two sum up to -x

**brute force -> $O(n^3)$** 



**Hashmap + pruning**

In this question, the pruning for removing duplication is the most time-comsuming and troublesome, rather than the query operation. So the hashmap is no longer a good way.



**sort + two pointers -> $O(n^2)$**

The better way is to sort first, then traverse the first x. For each x, find the remaining two nums sum up to -x. When sorted, the sum up can be calculated with two pointers walk in the opposite direction, which will only cost O(n).



> [18. 4Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum/)

Traverse the first two, and get the remaining two's sum target. ==Two sum with target can be solved in O(n) with two pointers(sorted)==.



**brute force -> $O(n^4)$** 



**sort + two pointers + pruning -> $O(n^2)$**

The framework is the same with 3Sum. For **pruning**:

- Fix the first num, `nums[i]`
  - if `nums[i] + nums[i+1] + nums[i+2] + nums[i+3] > target`, break the first loop.
  - if `nums[i] + nums[n-1] + nums[n-2] + nums[n-3] < target`, continue to the i+1 loop.
- Fix the first two nunms, `nums[i] nums[j]`
  - if `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[j+1] + nums[j+2] > target`, break the second loop.
  - if `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[n-1] + nums[n-2] < target`, continue to the j+1 loop.

> [454. 4Sum-ii](https://leetcode.com/problems/4sum-ii/) *

Split the four list in 2-2, traverse the first two lists to calculate the every possible sum and their nums of appearance, eg {sum: 3} and add to the dict. Traverse the second two lists, for each sum, check whether -sum in the dict.
