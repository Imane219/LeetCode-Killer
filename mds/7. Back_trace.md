# Back Trace

Back Trace algorithm is a kind of Deep First Search(DFS) on a Tree(no need to be a binary tree).

## In total

1. For an example input(do not be too simple), draw a tree for DFS.
2. When to stop recurse? -> record the depth of the tree.
3. How to prune? -> return in some specific condition.

### Template

```python
def backtracing(params):
    if end_condition:
        processing
    for i in nodes_in_the_current_layer:
        processing
        backtracing(modified_params)
        processing
```



## Problems

> [77. Combinations](https://leetcode.com/problems/combinations/description/)

from [1,n] choose k non-redundant elements.

- construct a normal tree, search for every position in k.
- construct a binary tree, search for every element(choose or not) in n.

**Pruning** conditions can be found during the drawing of tree.
