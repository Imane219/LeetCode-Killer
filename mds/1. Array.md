# Array

Array is a data structure that O(1) when search, O(n) when insert.

## Basic syntax

### create/del a list

```python
l = []
l = list()

del l
```

### operations

```python
## slice
l[beg:end:step]   # when step <0, beg need to > end.

# inplace operations, returns None!!
l.append()
l.extend()   # input is sequence, so "a" is ok, but 3 is not.
l.reverse()  # l[::-1], return None
```



## Binary Search

> [704. Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/description/) sorted **unique** numbers

### Details need to remember:

- **Initializing boundary** needs to cover all elements: `l=0, r=length-1`

- **Calculating mid** needs to consider integer overflow

  ```python
  mid = (l+r)//2  # very easy to overflow
  mid = l + (r-l)//2  # better, but still possible
  mid = (l+r) >> 1  # the best
  ```

- **Pick left `mid` or right `mid`** (matters when dealing with even elements)

  ```python
  mid = (l+r) >> 1  # left mid
  mid = (l+r+1) >> 1  # right mid
  ```

  it depends on how you write the ```if ... else```.

  Just imagine there are only 2 elements left, and the procedure falls into the 'else block'. The wrong mid will result in an infinite loop because neither `l` nor `r` makes a move. You need to make sure that each move shrinks the `r-l`.

  **left mid with > condition(target falls into right half)**

  ```python
  mid = (l+r) >> 1
  
  if target > nums[mid]:
      l = mid + 1  # mid is not the answer
  else:
      r = mid  # mid might be the answer
  ```

  **exit condition:** `l==r` and right (or equal) to the target // except for target lying in the right of the list.

  Left mid uses `l` to get close to the target. If the target doesn't exist in the list, the pointers both stop at the first number bigger than it.

  0 1 2 3 4 5, target: 2.5, `l==r==3`; target: 6, `l==r==5`

  **right mid with < condition(target falls into left half)**

  ```python
  mid = (l+r+1) >> 1
  
  if target < nums[mid]:
      r = mid - 1
  else:
      l = mid
  ```

  **exit condition:** `l==r` and left (or equal) to the target // except for target lying in the left of the list.

  Right mid uses `r` to get close to the target. If the target doesn't exist in the list, the pointers both stop at the last number smaller than it.

  0 1 2 3 4 5, target: 2.5, `l==r==2`; target: -1, `l==r==0`

- **While loop**

  ```python
  while(l<r):
      ...
  return l if nums[l]==target else -1
  ```

  **exit condition:** the list is empty -> `l > r`; non-empty -> `l==r`

  

> [34. First and last index](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/) sorted **nonunique** numbers

When the numbers are non-unique, the exit condition changes a little:

â€‹	0 1 2 3 3 3 4 , target: 3

- **left mid**: when hit the target number, `r` will keep moving left until meets `l`

  **exit condition:** if target in the list, `l==r==the first target num index`

- **right mid:** when hit the target number, `l` will keep moving right until meets `r`

  **exit condition:** if target in the list,`l==r==the last target num index`

## Two pointers

In summary, two pointers method is used for:

1. cut down one `for loop`, from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$.
2. need one pointer as index, one to process elements -> same direction
3. convenient to process together of head and end -> opposite direction

> [27. Remove Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/description/)

- Two pointers walk in the **same direction**: one to keep the result list, one to iterate the list.
- Two pointers walk in the **opposite direction**: left for searching in sequence, right for picking the element to replace.

#### Sliding Window

> [209. minimum size subarray sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/)

- l and r move in the **same direction **(start at the same place).
- while r explore for a bigger sum, l moves to shrink the window size.

## Sort algorithm

### Quick sort -> $O(nlogn)$

An recursive method with partitioning to two sub-arrays each time. Partition as follows:

1. pick a pivot -> `random index and swap it to a[0]`

2. two pointers l and r moving in the oppose direction, making the left part smaller than pivot and the right part bigger.

3. swap a[l] and a[r], return the index of where it is partitioned.

**Attention:**

- If a is sorted, index == l will result in $O(n^2)$, so random index is needed.
- If there are many repeated nums, line 7-8 can not include equal. If so, the partitioned sub-arrays are always one longer than another.

```python
def quicksort(a,l,r):
    if l >= r: return
    index = random.randint(l,r)  # [l,r]
    pivot = a[index]
    i, j = l, r
    while i <= j:   # Attention
        while a[j] > pivot: j -= 1   # can not include equal.
        while a[i] < pivot: i += 1   # can not include equal.
        if i > j: break              # Attention
        a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]
        j -= 1    # prevent j stuck at the pivot num.
        i += 1    # prevent i stuck at the pivot num.
    quicksort(a,l,i-1)
    quicksort(a,i,r)
```
