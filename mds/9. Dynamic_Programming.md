# Dynamic Programming

An algorithm that simplifies a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems in a recursive manner. The local optimum can lead to global optimum.

## In total

1. Create a dp[] to record the recursive results. -> Figure out the dp[i]'s meaning.
2. Conclude the recurrence relation.
3. Initialize the dp[].
4. 

### Tips

- Like problem 45, update the **end condition for one step** during iteration.
- The **changes of the summary** can also be used to judge.
- **Traversing twice** is a easy way to process sequences with ascending and descending.

## Problems

> [70. Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/description/) / Also Fibonacci.

- **dp[i]**:  the number of ways to achieve the i-th stair.
- **state transition**: dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]. Only need to record the previous two num.
- **initialize**: dp[0] -> meaningless; dp[1] -> 1; dp[2] -> 2
