# Graph

Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes(v) and edges(e). The graph is denoted by **G(V, E)**. It can be grouped into **directed graph** and **undirected graph**.

## Create a graph

If the number of edges are huge, use adjacency matrix, otherwise adjacency list.

### Adjacency Matrix

An matrix of boolean. Letâ€™s assume there are **n** nodes in the graph. So, the adjacency matrix `G` has dimension **n x n**.

- If there is an edge from node i to j, `G[i][j]==1`
- If there is an edge from node j to i, `G[j][i]==1`

The adjacency matrix of an undirected graph must be symmetric. 

### Adjacency List

The graph is represented as a collection of linked lists. There is an array of pointer which points to the edges connected to that node.



## Traversal of a graph

### BFS















### Union Find Sets

**Union find sets** is used to find the father of the set, and merge different sets.

UFS can be used to:

- Find connected components in a graph.

```python
# initialize
f[x] = x
def find(f,x):
    if f[x] == x:
        return x
    else:
        f[x] = find(f,f[x])
        return f[x]

def merge(f,x,y):
    fx = find(f,x)
    fy = find(f,y)
    f[fx] = fy
```

> [765. Couples Holding Hands](https://leetcode.com/problems/couples-holding-hands/)

For each couple, represent them as a node. If the two person sit together are belong to couple1 and couple2, the two nodes should exchange person -> merge the two nodes.

The ans would be the sum of `the number of edges`-1 of different connected components.
